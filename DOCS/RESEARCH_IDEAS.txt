Research Ideas:

Compare and contrast applications for "tracking by detection" and traditional tracking.
	Traditional tracking:
		Excels with high measurement frequency
		Requires mathematical models.
	Machine Learning:
		No model needed.
		Computationally expensive.
		Good for detecting unexpected things.

For negative lambda, the response function h is a completley different shape. As t approaches infinity h 
appears to approache zero, while the opposite is true for the previous problem.

The numerical convolution also has a compleley different shape, it looks like a damped oscillator but biased
towards zero.

The analytical convolution for some reason looks like the previously calculated numerical convolution.

title = {A Brief Tutorial on the Ensemble Kalman Filter},
year = {2009},
abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a recursive filter suitable for problems with a large number of variables, such as discretizations of partial differential equations in geophysical models. The EnKF originated as a version of the Kalman filter for large problems (essentially, the covariance matrix is replaced by the sample covariance), and it is now an important data assimilation component of ensemble forecasting. EnKF is related to the particle filter (in this context, a particle is the same thing as an ensemble member) but the EnKF makes the assumption that all probability distributions involved are Gaussian. This article briefly describes the derivation and practical implementation of the basic version of EnKF, and reviews several extensions.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a nonlinear estimation algorithm that combines generalized polynomial chaos theory and higher moment updates. Polynomial chaos theory is used to predict the evolution of uncertainty of the nonlinear random process, and higher order moment updates are used to estimate the posterior non Gaussian probability density function of the random process. The moments are updated using a linear gain. The nonlinear estimation algorithm is then applied to the duffing oscillator system with initial condition uncertainty and its performance is compared with linear estimators based on extended Kalman filtering framework. We observe that this estimator outperforms the linear estimator when measurements are not available very frequently, thus highlighting the need for nonlinear estimator in such scenarios.},

Several continuous and discrete processes are treated, and numerical examples show substantial speed-up compared to Monte Carlo simulations for low dimensional stochastic inputs.},

abstract = {Machine learning techniques have seen a tremendous rise in popularity in weather and climate sciences. Data assimilation (DA), which combines observations and numerical models, has great potential to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML/AI) techniques. In this paper, we use U-Net, a type of convolutional neutral network (CNN), to predict the localized ensemble covariances for the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm. Using a 2-layer quasi-geostrophic model, U-Nets are trained using data from EnKF DA experiments. The trained U-Nets are then used to predict the flow-dependent localized error covariance matrices in U-Net Kalman Filter (UNetKF) experiments, which are compared to traditional 3-dimensional variational (3DVar), ensemble 3DVar (En3DVar) and EnKF methods. The performance of UNetKF can match or exceed that of 3DVar, En3DVar or EnKF. We also demonstrate that trained U-Nets can be transferred to a higher-resolution model for UNetKF implementation, which again performs competitively to 3DVar and EnKF, particularly for small ensemble sizes.},

@article{GilpinWilliam2021Caai,
abstract = {The striking fractal geometry of strange attractors underscores the generative nature of chaos: like probability distributions, chaotic systems can be repeatedly measured to produce arbitrarily-detailed information about the underlying attractor. Chaotic systems thus pose a unique challenge to modern statistical learning techniques, while retaining quantifiable mathematical properties that make them controllable and interpretable as benchmarks. Here, we present a growing database currently comprising 131 known chaotic dynamical systems spanning fields such as astrophysics, climatology, and biochemistry. Each system is paired with precomputed multivariate and univariate time series. Our dataset has comparable scale to existing static time series databases; however, our systems can be re-integrated to produce additional datasets of arbitrary length and granularity. Our dataset is annotated with known mathematical properties of each system, and we perform feature analysis to broadly categorize the diverse dynamics present across the collection. Chaotic systems inherently challenge forecasting models, and across extensive benchmarks we correlate forecasting performance with the degree of chaos present. We also exploit the unique generative properties of our dataset in several proof-of-concept experiments: surrogate transfer learning to improve time series classification, importance sampling to accelerate model training, and benchmarking symbolic regression algorithms.},

@article{ZhangYuanzhao2023Corc,
abstract = {Reservoir computing (RC) is a simple and efficient model-free framework for forecasting the behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems from data. Here, we show that there exist commonly-studied systems for which leading RC frameworks struggle to learn the dynamics unless key information about the underlying system is already known. We focus on the important problem of basin prediction—determining which attractor a system will converge to from its initial conditions. First, we show that the predictions of standard RC models (echo state networks) depend critically on warm-up time, requiring a warm-up trajectory containing almost the entire transient in order to identify the correct attractor. Accordingly, we turn to next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC), an attractive variant of RC that requires negligible warm-up time. By incorporating the exact nonlinearities in the original equations, we show that NGRC can accurately reconstruct intricate and high-dimensional basins of attraction, even with sparse training data (e.g., a single transient trajectory). Yet, a tiny uncertainty in the exact nonlinearity can render prediction accuracy no better than chance. Our results highlight the challenges faced by data-driven methods in learning the dynamics of multistable systems and suggest potential avenues to make these approaches more robust.},

@article{LukoševičiusMantas2009Rcat,
abstract = {Echo State Networks and Liquid State Machines introduced a new paradigm in artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) training, where an RNN (the
reservoir) is generated randomly and only a readout is trained. The paradigm, becoming known as
reservoir computing, greatly facilitated the practical application of RNNs and outperformed classical fully trained RNNs in many tasks. It has lately become a vivid research field with numerous extensions of the basic idea, including reservoir adaptation, thus broadening the initial paradigm to
using different methods for training the reservoir and the readout. This review systematically surveys both current ways of generating/adapting the reservoirs and training different types of readouts. It offers a natural conceptual classification of the techniques, which transcends boundaries of the current “brand-names” of reservoir methods, and thus aims to help in unifying the field and providing the reader with a detailed “map” of it.},

abstract = {In this paper, we prove that any finite time trajectory of a given n-dimensional dynamical system can be approximately realized by the internal state of the output units of a continuous time recurrent neural network with n output units, some hidden units, and an appropriate initial condition. The essential idea of the proof is to embed the n-dimensional dynamical system into a higher dimensional one which defines a recurrent neural network. As a corollary, we also show that any continuous curve can be approximated by the output of a recurrent neural network.},

Echo State Network (ESN) is one of the key reservoir computing “flavors”. While being practical, conceptually simple, and easy to implement, ESNs require some experience and insight to achieve the hailed good performance in many tasks. Here we present practical techniques and recommendations for successfully applying ESNs, as well as some more advanced application-specific modifications.},

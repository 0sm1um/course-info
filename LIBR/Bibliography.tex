title = {A Brief Tutorial on the Ensemble Kalman Filter},
year = {2009},
abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a recursive filter suitable for problems with a large number of variables, such as discretizations of partial differential equations in geophysical models. The EnKF originated as a version of the Kalman filter for large problems (essentially, the covariance matrix is replaced by the sample covariance), and it is now an important data assimilation component of ensemble forecasting. EnKF is related to the particle filter (in this context, a particle is the same thing as an ensemble member) but the EnKF makes the assumption that all probability distributions involved are Gaussian. This article briefly describes the derivation and practical implementation of the basic version of EnKF, and reviews several extensions.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a nonlinear estimation algorithm that combines generalized polynomial chaos theory and higher moment updates. Polynomial chaos theory is used to predict the evolution of uncertainty of the nonlinear random process, and higher order moment updates are used to estimate the posterior non Gaussian probability density function of the random process. The moments are updated using a linear gain. The nonlinear estimation algorithm is then applied to the duffing oscillator system with initial condition uncertainty and its performance is compared with linear estimators based on extended Kalman filtering framework. We observe that this estimator outperforms the linear estimator when measurements are not available very frequently, thus highlighting the need for nonlinear estimator in such scenarios.},

Several continuous and discrete processes are treated, and numerical examples show substantial speed-up compared to Monte Carlo simulations for low dimensional stochastic inputs.},

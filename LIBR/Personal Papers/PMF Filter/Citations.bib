abstract = {The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode-Shannon representation of random processes and the “state-transition” method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

abstract = {A new sequential data assimilation method is discussed. It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well‐known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.},

abstract = {The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is a computational technique for approximate inference in state-space models. In typical applications, the state vectors are large spatial fields that are observed sequentially over time. The EnKF approximates the Kalman filter by representing the distribution of the state with an ensemble of draws from that distribution. The ensemble members are updated based on newly available data by shifting instead of reweighting, which allows the EnKF to avoid the degeneracy problems of reweighting-based algorithms. Taken together, the ensemble representation and shifting-based updates make the EnKF computationally feasible even for extremely high-dimensional state spaces. The EnKF is successfully used in data-assimilation applications with tens of millions of dimensions. While it implicitly assumes a linear Gaussian state-space model, it has also turned out to be remarkably robust to deviations from these assumptions in many applications. Despite its successes, the EnKF is largely unknown in the statistics community. We aim to change that with the present article, and to entice more statisticians to work on this topic.},

abstract = {Abstract The stochastic ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) updates its ensemble members with observations perturbed with noise sampled from the distribution of the observational errors.

This work introduces an efficient serial scheme to mitigate the impact of observations’ perturbations sampling in the analysis step of the EnKF, which should provide more accurate ensemble estimates of the analysis error covariance matrices. The new scheme is simple to implement within the serial EnKF algorithm, requiring only the approximation of the EnKF sample forecast error covariance matrix by a matrix with one rank less. The new EnKF scheme is implemented and tested with the Lorenz-96 model. Results from numerical experiments are conducted to compare its performance with the EnKF and two standard deterministic EnKFs. This study shows that the new scheme enhances the behavior of the EnKF and may lead to better performance than the deterministic EnKFs even when implemented with relatively small ensembles.},

abstract = {Abstract Recently various versions of ensemble Kalman filters (EnKFs) have been proposed and studied. This work concerns, in a mathematically rigorous manner, the relative performance of two major versions of EnKF when the forecast ensemble is non-Gaussian. The approach is based on the stability of the filtering methods against small model violations, using the expected squared L2 distance as a measure of the deviation between the updated distributions. Analytical and experimental results suggest that both stochastic and deterministic EnKFs are sensitive to the violation of the Gaussian assumption, while the stochastic filter is relatively more stable than the deterministic filter under certain circumstances, especially when there are wild outliers. These results not only agree with previous empirical studies, but also suggest a natural choice of a free parameter in the square root Kalman filter algorithm.},

@article{LivingsDavidM2008Uesr,
issn = {0167-2789},
abstract = {There is an established framework that describes a class of ensemble Kalman filter algorithms as square root filters (SRFs). These algorithms produce analyses by updating a state estimate and a square root of the ensemble covariance matrix. The matrix square root of the forecast covariance is post-multiplied by another matrix to give a matrix square root of the analysis covariance. The choice of post-multiplier is not unique and can be multiplied by any orthogonal matrix to give another scheme that is also a SRF. Not all filters of this type bear the desired relationship to the forecast ensemble: the analysis ensemble mean may not be equal to the analysis state estimate and consequently there may be an accompanying shortfall in the spread of the analysis ensemble as expressed by the ensemble covariance matrix. This points to the need for a restricted version of the notion of an ensemble SRF, which we call an unbiased ensemble SRF. This paper provides a generic set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the scheme to be centred on the analysis state estimate (unbiased). A few of these results have already been published elsewhere in the literature; this paper brings these together with new results and provides simple proofs and examples, as well as a mathematical description of the set of unbiased ensemble SRFs. Many (but not all) published ensemble SRF algorithms satisfy the criteria that we establish. While these conditions are not a cure-all and cannot deal with independent sources of bias such as model and observation errors, they should be useful to designers of ensemble SRFs in the future.},

abstract = {Interpolation of a spatially correlated random process is used in many scientific areas. The best unbiased linear predictor, often called a kriging predictor in geostatistical science, requires the solution of a (possibly large) linear system based on the covariance matrix of the observations. In this article, we show that tapering the correct covariance matrix with an appropriate compactly supported positive definite function reduces the computational burden significantly and still leads to an asymptotically optimal mean squared error. The effect of tapering is to create a sparse approximate linear system that can then be solved using sparse matrix algorithms. Monte Carlo simulations support the theoretical results. An application to a large climatological precipitation dataset is presented as a concrete and practical illustration.},

abstract = {We present a Rao-Blackwellized point mass filter (RB-PMF) as a deterministic counterpart of the Rao-Blackwellized marginal particle filter (RB-MPF). The main advantage of the proposed filter is its deterministic nature that results in the same estimate for repeated runs over the same data. Moreover, the point mass approximation offers more reliable representation of the tails of the posterior distribution. This results in more reliable tracking of low probability events, which is demonstrated on a simulated example of sine wave tracking. Due to Rao-Blackwellization, the proposed filter is capable to estimate problems of higher dimensions than the original point mass filter. This is demonstrated on estimation of a demanding five dimensional problem.},
